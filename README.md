# MaFolder

##### What is MaFolder

MaFolder is a unique Ai tool that has the ability to analyse files and correctly direct them to folders based on user written requirments

View this tool as a keyword feature, where you only accept files with certain keywords, but instead this tool is broader which can include anything that a user wants a file to have including; file name, file content, context, pages, file extensions etc. This allows for flexible and precise categorization beyond traditional rules-based systems.


##### Current Progress

I have been succesfully able to make the tool function correctly using deepseek 14B and prompt engineering for a  accurate output. Files such as pdf, docx, ppt, txt, csv etc are converted to md, and are sent to the llm to deal with.

Then based on the output, my tool automatically redirects the file from its current path to the folder path that it belongs to.

Based on my tests, on average the tool is able to analyse and relocate small files in 5 seconds per file. Which is a amazing start, and hopefully would like to decrease this to a couple of second per file (and also big files). 


##### Future Plans

Firsty I would like to try and edit, or improve the requirement that users are able to speicfy. I would like the requirements to not be a duplicate to other requirement, I would like the requirements to be reasonable.

I have so many ideas for this specific tool that can help assist different companies and fields to help assist them with file managment effectively and efficiently such as include image detection (which is currently expensive for me to include), use of bigger llms to identify more context and accuracy.
